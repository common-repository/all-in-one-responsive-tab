<strong>How To Use</strong>

<p>When you go to your Wordpress Dashboard you will now see a new custom post named <strong>Aio Res Tab </strong>in your left toolbar under 

<strong>pages.</strong> This will allow you to quickly create All In One Responsive Tab items on your site.</p>


<p>

I am Describing Below How to Create TAB Items Step By Step:</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<strong>Adding TAB Items In Aio res Custom POst</strong></p>

<p>
Once you see custom post name <strong>Aio Res Tab</strong>On your Dashboard left under <strong>pages.</strong> just click Add New Item :
</p>

<strong>Then you will see Style 1. just Check style 1  You will see the Tab Setting option panel</strong>

<p>
1. <strong>First field</strong>: "ID" ID is most important to add Tab Items. First ID must be '1'. 
If you add more tab items then ID Number should maintain serial with same as tab items.
Ex: if you create 1 item then ID should be "1", 
If you create 2nd Items then ID should be "2" , 
And If you create 3nd Items then ID should be "3"  
</p>

<p>
2. <strong>Second field</strong>: "Highlight Item" Which item Do you want to Active? just seclect Yes. I think 1st Item Always Should Active. So Just 1st Items make "Highlight Item" Yes, And Other Items Should Value "no".
</p>

<p>
3. <strong>Third field</strong> "Menu Name" You can Write any Menu Name.
</p>

<p>
4. <strong>Fourth Field</strong>: "Select Menu Icon" There is so many Font-awesome Icon. You can Chose anyone For your Menu.
</p>


<p>
5. <strong> Five Field</strong> : "Title" Put Any Title as you want.
</p>

<p>
6. <strong> Six Field</strong> : "Tab Content" Put Any Content as you want. You can use any HTML elements inside tabs content: text, images, audio, video, etc.
</p>

<p>
After all of the steps above are done you will see a Menu named <strong>Add more All in one responsive tab</strong>. If you want to add more items just click <strong>Add more All in one responsive tab</strong> and you will see another field open; you can then add unlimited items.
</p>

==> <h3> Style 1 TAB Settings panel</h3>:

<p>
=> <strong>TAB Layout </strong> : "There are 3 Layout For TAB Style.
<u>
<li>Top Left</li>
<li>Top Right</li>
<li>Top Center</li>
</u>
You can chose any one As you like
.
